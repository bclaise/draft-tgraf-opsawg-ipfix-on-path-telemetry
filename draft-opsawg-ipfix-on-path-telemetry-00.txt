1.  Introduction

   Network operators want a statistical delay view of their networks.
   They want to understand where in the network, for which customer
   traffic, how much and why delay is being accummlated.  In order to
   answer why and where, delay needs to be reported into device and
   control-plane context.  In order to understand which customer traffic
   is affected, delay needs to be reported into customer data-plane
   context.  That enables network operators to quickly identify when the
   control-plane updates the current path with a different next-hop and
   therefore the forwarding path changes to different nodes and
   interfaces, how the path delay changes for which customer traffic.

   With On-Path Telemetry, described in the Network Telemetry Framework
   [RFC9232] and applied in In-situ OAM [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-deployment],
   Path Tracing [I-D.filsfils-spring-path-tracing] and In-situ Flow
   Information Telemetry [I-D.song-opsawg-ifit-framework], the path
   delay between two endpoints is measured by inserting a timestamp in
   the packet.

   On-Path Telemetry can be distinguished between two modes.  Passport
   mode, [RFC9197], where only the last hop in the forwarding path of
   the On-Path Telemetry domain exposes all the metrics, and postcard
   mode, [I-D.song-ippm-postcard-based-telemetry], where the metrics are
   also exposed in the transit nodes.  In both modes the forwarding path
   exposes performance metrics allowing to determine how much delay has
   been accumulated on which hop.

   This document defines eight new IPFIX Information Elements (IEs),
   exposing the On-Path delay on IOAM transit and decapsulation nodes.
   Since these IPFIX IEs are performance metrics [RFC8911], they must be
   registered as registered performance metrics [RFC8911] in the "IANA
   Performance Metric Registry [IANA-PERF-METRIC].

   Table 1: Correspondance between IE and performance metric registry

   The delay is measured by calculating the difference between the
   timestamp imposed with On-Path Telemetry in the packet at the IOAM
   encapsulation node and the timestamp exported in the IPFIX flow
   record from the IOAM transit and decapsulation nodes.  Depending on
   the IE, the lowest, highest or the sum of measured path delay is
   being exported.

3.1.  IP One-Way Delay Hybrid Type I Passive Registry Entries

   This section specifies four Registry Entries for the Hybrid Type I
   Passive assessment of IP One-Way Delay.

   All column entries besides the ID, Name, Description, and Output
   Reference Method categories are the same; thus, this section defines
   four closely related Registry Entries.  As a result, IANA has
   assigned corresponding URLs to each of the four Named Metrics.

3.1.2.  Description

   This metric assesses the one-way delay of IP packets constituting a
   single connection between two hosts.  We consider the measurement of
   one-way delay based on a single Observation Point (OP) [RFC7011]
   somewhere in the network.  The output is the one-way delay for all
   successfully forwarded packets expressed as the <statistic> of their
   conditional delay distribution, where <statistic> is one of:

   *  Mean

   *  Min

   *  Max

   *  Sum

   With the OP [RFC7011] typically located between the hosts
   participating in the IP connection, the one-way delay metric requires
   one individual measurement between the OP and sourcing host, such
   that the Spatial Composition [RFC6049] of the measurements yields a
   one-way delay singleton.

3.2.2.  Fixed Parameters

   Traffic Filters:

    IPv4 header values:
      DSCP: Set to 0

    IPv6 header values:
      DSCP: Set to 0
      Hop Count: Set to 255
      Flow Label: Set to 0
      Extension Headers: None

3.3.  Method of Measurement

   This category includes columns for references to relevant sections of
   the RFC(s) and any supplemental information needed to ensure an
   unambiguous method for implementations.

3.3.1.  Reference Methods

   The foundational methodology for this metric is defined in section 4
   of [RFC7323] using the Timestamps option with modifications that
   allow application at a mid-path OP [RFC7011].

3.3.5.  Runtime Parameters and Data Format

   Runtime Parameters are input factors that must be determined,
   configured into the measurement system, and reported with the results
   for the context to be complete.

   Src:  The IP address of the host in the host A Role (format
      ipv4-address-no-zone value for IPv4 or ipv6-address-no-zone value
      for IPv6; see section 4 of [RFC6991].

   Dst:  The IP address of the host in the host B Role (format
      ipv4-address-no-zone value for IPv4 or ipv6-address-no-zone value
      for IPv6; see section 4 of [RFC6991].

   TTL or Hop Limit:  Set at desired value.

   DSCP:  Set at desired value.

   IPv6 Flow Label:  Set at desired value.

   Timestamp:  The timestamp when the packet is being received at IOAM
      encapsulation node.  Format depends on On-Path Telemetry
      implementation.  For IOAM, Section 4.4.1 of [RFC9197] describes
      what kind of timestamps are supported.  Section 4.4.2.3 and
      4.4.2.4 describe where the timestamp is being inserted.  For Path
      Tracing, Section 4.1 of [I-D.filsfils-spring-path-tracing]
      describes what kind of timestamps are supported.  Section 9.2
      describe the SRH path tracing TLV where the timestamp is being
      inserted.

3.3.6.  Roles

   host A:  Launches the IP packet to open the connection.  The Role of
      "host A" is synonymous with the IP address used at host A.

   host B:  Receives the IP packet to open the connection.  The Role of
      "host B" is synonymous with the IP address used at host B.

   Encapsulation Node:  Receives the IP packet to open the connection
      and encapsulates the timestamp into the packet.  The Role of
      "Encapsulation Node" is synonymous with the timestamp inserted in
      the packet.

   Transit Node:  Receives the IP packet to open the connection and
      measures the delay between the timestamp in the packet and the
      timestamp when the packet was received.

   Decapsulation Node:  Receives the IP packet to open the connection

      and measures the delay between the timestamp in the packet and the
      timestamp when the packet was received and removes the IOAM header
      from the packet.

3.4.  Output

   This category specifies all details of the output of measurements
   using the metric.

3.4.1.  Type

   OWDelay Types are discussed in the subsections below.

3.4.2.  Reference Definition

   For all output types:

   OWDelay_HybridType1_Passive_IP:  The one-trip delay of one IP packet
      is a Singleton

   For each <statistic>, Singleton one of the following subsections
   applies.

3.4.2.1.  Mean

   The mean SHALL be calculated using the conditional distribution of
   all packets with a finite value of one-way delay (undefined delays
   are excluded) -- a single value, as follows:

4.  IPFIX Information Elements

   This section defines and describes the new IPFIX IEs.

   PathDelayMeanDeltaMicroseconds
      16-bit unsigned integer that identifies the mean path delay in
      microseconds, between the IOAM encapsulation node and the local
      node with the IOAM domain (either an IOAM transit node or an IOAM
      decapsulation node).

   PathDelayMeanDeltaNanoseconds
      32-bit unsigned integer that identifies the mean path delay in
      nanoseconds, between the IOAM encapsulation node and the local
      node with the IOAM domain (either an IOAM transit node or an IOAM
      decapsulation node).

   PathDelayMinDeltaMicroseconds
      16-bit unsigned integer that identifies the lowest path delay in
      microseconds, between the IOAM encapsulation node and the local
      node with the IOAM domain (either an IOAM transit node or an IOAM
      decapsulation node).

   PathDelayMinDeltaNanoseconds
      32-bit unsigned integer that identifies the lowest path delay in
      nanoseconds, between the IOAM encapsulation node and the local
      node with the IOAM domain (either an IOAM transit node or an IOAM
      decapsulation node).

   PathDelayMaxDeltaMicroseconds
      16-bit unsigned integer that identifies the highest path delay in
      microseconds, between the IOAM encapsulation node and the local
      node with the IOAM domain (either an IOAM transit node or an IOAM
      decapsulation node).

   PathDelayMaxDeltaNanoseconds
      32-bit unsigned integer that identifies the highest path delay in
      nanoseconds, between the IOAM encapsulation node and the local
      node with the IOAM domain (either an IOAM transit node or an IOAM
      decapsulation node).

Internet-Draft      Export of On-Path Delay in IPFIX        January 2023


   PathDelaySumDeltaMicroseconds
      32-bit unsigned integer that identifies the sum of the path delay
      in microseconds, between the IOAM encapsulation node and the local
      node with the IOAM domain (either an IOAM transit node or an IOAM
      decapsulation node).

   PathDelaySumDeltaNanoseconds
      64-bit unsigned integer that identifies the sum of the path delay
      in nanoseconds, between the IOAM encapsulation node and the local
      node with the IOAM domain (either an IOAM transit node or an IOAM
      decapsulation node).

5.  Use Cases

   The measured On-Path delay can be aggregated with Flow Aggregation as
   defined in [RFC7015] to the following device and control-plane
   dimensions to determine:

   *  With node id and egressInterface(IE14), on which node which
      logical egress interfaces have been contributing to how much
      delay.

   *  With node id and egressPhysicalInterface(253), on which node which
      physical egress interfaces have been contributing to how much
      delay.

   *  With ipNextHopIPv4Address(IE15) or ipNextHopIPv6Address(IE62), the
      forwarding path to which next-hop IP contributed to how much
      delay.

   *  With mplsTopLabelIPv4Address(IE47) or srhActiveSegmentIPv6 from
      [I-D.tgraf-opsawg-ipfix-srv6-srh], the forwarding path to which
      MPLS top label IPv4 address or SRv6 active segment contributed to
      how much delay.

   *  BGP communities are often used for setting a path priority or
      service selection.  With bgpDestinationExtendedCommunityList(488)
      or bgpDestinationCommunityList(485) or
      bgpDestinationLargeCommunityList(491) which group of prefixes
      accumulated at which node how much delay.

   *  With destinationIPv4Address(13), destinationTransportPort(11),
      protocolIdentifier (4) and sourceIPv4Address(IE8), the forwarding
      path delay on each node from each IPv4 source address to a
      specific application in the network.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  Performance Metrics

   This document requests IANA to create new performance metrics under
   the "Performance Metrics" registry [RFC8911] with the values defined
   in section 2.

6.2.  IPFIX Entities

   This document requests IANA to create new IEs (see table 3) under the
   "IPFIX Information Elements" registry [RFC7012] available at "IANA
   Performance Metric Registry [IANA-PERF-METRIC] and assign the
   following initial code points.

7.  Operational Considerations

7.1.  Time Accuracy

   The same recommendation as defined in section 4.5 of [RFC5153] for
   IPFIX applies in terms of clock precision to this document as well.

7.2.  Mean Delay

   The mean (average) path delay can be calculated by dividing the
   PathDelaySumDeltaMicroseconds(TBD5) or
   PathDelaySumDeltaNanoseconds(TBD6) by the packetDeltaCount(2) at the
   IPFIX data collection.

Internet-Draft      Export of On-Path Delay in IPFIX        January 2023


7.3.  IOAM Packet Time Stamps

   For IOAM, Section 4.4.1 of [RFC9197] describes what kind of
   timestamps are supported.  Section 4.4.2.3 and 4.4.2.4 describe where
   the timestamp is being inserted.

   For Path Tracing, Section 4.1 of [I-D.filsfils-spring-path-tracing]
   describes what kind of timestamps are supported.  Section 9.2
   describe the SRH path tracing TLV where the timestamp is being
   inserted.

8.  Security Considerations

   There are no significant extra security considerations regarding the
   allocation of these new IPFIX IEs compared to [RFC7012].
